`chromedriver` - An NPM wrapper for Selenium ChromeDriver.

`prettier` - Code formatter for JavaScript, TypeScript, and more.

## :runner: Running the Framework :runner:

Before you're ready to run any of the scripts, you need to do the following:
- Launch the backend in a new terminal following this: Backend [docs](./../backend/README.md)
- Launch the frontend in a new terminal following this: Frontend [docs](./../web/README.md)

It is imperative that you do these steps or you **will** run into issues trying to use the framework.

### Scripts

- `npm run test`: Run all the tests presnet in the framework (API+UI)
    note: if you want to run a single test you need to use mochaGrept.
    I.E.: `npm run test -- --mochaOpts.grep 009` will run the test with ID=`009`.

- `clean-report`: Removes the allure-results data
- `generate-report`: Generates an allure report
- `open-report`: Opens the allure report/test run results
- `clean-report-win`: Removes the allure-results data if you are working from a windows terminal.

It is importat that you run `clean-report` before execute the test to generate a new clean report!.

### Other Scripts

- `lint:check`: Check lint rules
- `lint:fix`: Apply lint fixes
- `prettier:check`: Check prettier rules
- `prettier:fix`: Apply prettier rules

### ðŸ”” Allure ðŸ””

Allure is used in this framework. Once you've executed a test(s) an .xml file will be generated under the output folder. You can then use the `generate-report` command to generate an HTML report and then open it with `open-report` command. Below is an example of what that report looks like. You have everything from test execution time, to graphs with test history, filtering for specific tests, to category breakdowns.
